## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts - For custom typography

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my skills in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox. I also gained experience in implementing custom CSS properties for consistent styling across the project. Here's an example of how I used CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --grey: hsl(0, 0%, 50%);
  --black: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on:

- Improving my CSS animation skills to create more dynamic user interfaces.
- Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Implementing accessibility features to ensure the card is usable for all users.
- Learning how to use CSS preprocessors like Sass to write more efficient styles
